## **1. What is the AI Meeting Bot for?**

**Common Use Cases:**

- **Executives & Management:** Stay on top of key decisions through AI summaries without having to attend every single meeting.

- **Sales Teams:** Focus entirely on the prospect and build rapport instead of juggling manual note-taking.

- **Operations:** Maintain an accurate record of every task, owner, and deadline discussed during the session.

## **2. How to Use the AI Meeting Bot**

You can deploy the Bot in two ways: **Manually** or **Automatically**.

### **Method 1: Manual Launch (On-Demand)**

1. Select **Live Meeting** from the left-hand menu.

2. Paste your meeting link (Google Meet, Zoom, etc.) into the box labeled **"Paste the meeting invite link here."**

3. Select the spoken language in the **Transcript Language** dropdown (e.g., Vietnamese).

4. Click **AI Summary**. The Bot will request to join the meeting and start recording immediately.

### **Method 2: Auto-Join (For Busy Schedules)**

Set the Bot to automatically join any meeting on your calendar:

1. **Sync Your Calendar:** Go to the **Upcoming Meetings** menu and click **Connect Google Calendar**.

2. **Enable Global Auto-Join:** Go to **Settings > Meeting Bot** and toggle on **"Automatically record online meetings from calendar events."**

3. **Customize Individual Meetings:** In your **Upcoming Meetings** list, you can manually toggle the **Auto-join** switch for specific meetings you want the Bot to attend.

## **3. FAQ**

### Q: How will the Bot appear in the meeting?

A: By default, the Bot is named "NoteX Bot" or "\[Your Name]'s NoteX AI Bot." You can customize this display name under Settings > Meeting Bot.

### Q: Do I need to keep the NoteX tab open during the meeting?

A: No. Once the Bot has joined the call, it runs independently. You can close your browser; your transcript and summary will be waiting in All Notes as soon as the meeting ends.
