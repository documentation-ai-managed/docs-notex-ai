## **1. When Should You Use Nova Assistant?**

**Typical Use Cases:**

- **Action & Task Management:** Generate to-do lists, track pending issues, or use **Decision Recall** to find exactly what was agreed upon in meetings.

- **Knowledge Management:** Summarize lecture notes, extract specific data points/quotes, or perform **Cross-source Synthesis** to combine knowledge from multiple files.

- **Analytics & Reporting:** Automatically generate weekly reports, analyze workloads, or perform **Gap Detection** to find flaws in your planning.

- **Personal Reflection:** Surface old ideas or distill key insights from your work journals.

## **2. How to Use Nova Assistant (Step-by-Step)**

### **Nova Chat with a Single Note**

Use this when you need to **deep-dive** into a specific piece of content (e.g., minutes from a meeting that just ended).

1. **Open the note** you want to work with.

2. **Activate Nova:** Click the Nova icon (the little robot) in the corner of your screen.

3. **Ask a question:** Type a specific prompt for that note.

   - *Example:* "Summarize Nam’s to-dos from this meeting and include the deadlines."

### **Nova Chat with All Notes**

Use this for a **"big picture" view** or to connect dots across different sources.

1. **Go to "All Notes":** Open the Nova Chat panel in the right sidebar.

2. **Pick a suggestion or enter a command:** You can use presets like "Summarize 3 recent notes" or type your own request.

3. **Synthesis Commands:** Enter prompts that require connecting information.

   - *Example:* "Based on my notes from the past month, what were the most discussed topics?" or "Create a weekly digest including: work completed, decisions made, and pending issues."

## **3. Source Citation**

**Source Citation** allows Nova Assistant to point out exactly which note a piece of information was pulled from. This enables managers and sales teams to verify data instantly without any manual searching.

**Common Use Cases:**

- **Data Verification:** Confirm the origin of a specific figure or key decision in a report.

- **Context Retrieval:** Click on a source to jump directly to the full context of the cited information.

## **4. FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions & Edge Cases**

### Q: How does Nova handle it if two notes contain conflicting information?

A: You can use the Conflict Detection feature. Simply ask: "Are there any contradictions between the Marketing and Dev decisions in this week's notes?" Nova will list the discrepancies for you to cross-check.

### Q: Is there a limit to how many notes Nova can summarize?

A: Nova is built to handle large datasets. However, for the most accurate results, we recommend narrowing the timeframe (e.g., "within the last week" or "the 5 most recent notes").
