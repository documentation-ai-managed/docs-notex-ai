## **FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions**

### Q: Can I export a PDF that includes the Mindmap?

A: Currently, the Export feature is optimized for text (Summary and Transcript). For Mindmaps, we recommend taking a screenshot for the highest image quality.

### Q: Why don't I see the "Download Audio" button?

A: This button only appears for notes created via "Live Recording" or "Audio Upload." Notes generated from YouTube links or Web links do not support audio downloads.

### Q: Does the Search feature look for keywords inside the summary text?

A: At this time, Search prioritizes titles and file types to ensure the fastest response time.
